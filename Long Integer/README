Hey Professor/Hao Liu,

	I uploaded a shell script that will run the .h and .cpp files that 
	live in my area on /afs and print the output to a text file in your
	home area as well as mine and then open it in gedit if you have your 
	X11 forwarding enabled. I tried to make my outputs easy to read,
	but because of the limited size of the terminal window, the output for 
	everything involing test case E spans onto multiple lines. So if you 
	open the output file it will hold the formatting for operations involving 
	test case E. 

	The output should should like this 
				AAAAAAAA
			sign    BBBBBBBB
			----------------
			AAAAAAA+BBBBBBBB
	but E will come out like this in the terminal

				EEEEEEEE
			EEEEEEEEEEEEEE
				BBBBBBBBBBBBB
			-------------------
				--------------
			EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE+BBB
				BBBBBBBBB
	So those aren't super easy to look at outside of a text editor.

Kind Regards,
John Homan
